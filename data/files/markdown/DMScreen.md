## House Rules and Clarifications

- [House Rules](/markdown/markdown/HouseRules.md)

### Attunement
At most 3 attunements at time. No duplicate items.

A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies
the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away
for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to
the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another
short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

### Travel speeds:

| Speed | Per hour | Per day (8 hours) | Other                       |
|:-----:|:---------|:------------------|:----------------------------|
| Slow  | 3.2 km   | 25.6 km           | Can be stealthy             |
| Normal| 4.8 km   | 38.4 km           | Can do one additional thing |
| Fast: | 6.4 km   | 51.2 km           | -5 Passive perception       |

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the
distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make
a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each
hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of
exhaustion.

**Navigate.** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost,
making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

**Draw a Map.** The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress
and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check
is required.

**Track.** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a
Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence(Investigation) check when the DM calls for it.

**Forage.** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and
water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

**Lookout.** Characters passive perception +5 for one general direction for
detecting danger.

### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump. 10 ft of running for full distace,
half if no speed.

Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

***Long Jump.***
Strength score ft.
Extra distance is DC 5 + 2 * distance in feet Strength (Athletics) check.

You must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle,
quarter of jump distance or lower.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

***High Jump.***
3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0) feet.
Extra height is DC 5 * distance in feet Strength (Athletics) check.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump.
Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump
plus 1.5 times your height.


## Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its
Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number
of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start
of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain
hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3
minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops
to 0 hit points.
