# House Rules

## Haggling
Charisma (Persuasion or some Item related skill) vs. DC 20 (or opposed check).
Difference x 2% of markup or discount.
Each day used looking for better deals DC -1.
Each successful check (DC 15 or higher) made to locate good seller or buyer DC -2
DC never below 1.

## Food and Water
Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion
caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and
drinks the full required amount.

### Food
A character needs one pound (0.5 kg) of food per day and can make food last longer
by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as
half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her
Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit,
a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of
eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

### Water
A character needs half gallon (2 l) of water per day, or one gallon (4 l) per
day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion
at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically
suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character
takes two levels in either case.

Standard waterskin (5 lb, 2 sp) contains half a gallon of water.
